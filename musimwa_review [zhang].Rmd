Most of the codes run well and you have answered the questions. I however could not run the codes i have indicated below. Could you re-check them to see if they do run. You have a few packages reinstalled more than once.

```{r}
s_ftg <- ftg %>% group_by(Group, SNPs_ID, add = TRUE) %>% distinct(base.composition) %>% summarize(n())
s_ftg1 <- s_ftg %>% mutate(snp_present = (`n()` > 1))%>% group_by(Group) %>% summarize(sum(snp_present))
ggplot(s_ftg1,aes(Group, `sum(snp_present)`)) + geom_col()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,hjust = 1))

```
